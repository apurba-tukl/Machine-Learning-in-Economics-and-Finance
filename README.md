# Case Studies in MachineLearning_in_Economics_and_finance

Here We are trying to apply Machine Learning and Data Science in understanding the important aspects of Macro Economics and Financial markets.

We perfromed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand how different factors contribute to the stock market sentiment and the economy and then tried to forecast different metrices of the market through individual case studies,

Case studies are as follows,

1. Analyse and predict Electronic signing of Loans.
2. Predicting the possibility of default of Credit cards.
3. Understanding the good and risky hybrid mutual funds through Exploratory Data Analysis.
4. Predict stock prices in New York Stock exchange with Deep learning algorithms.
5. Investment growth prediction of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on a year on year(YoY) basis and how the Monetary policies are enforced by the central bank such as RBI.
